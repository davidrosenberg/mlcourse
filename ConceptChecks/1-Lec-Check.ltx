\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Concept Check Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $\AA=\YY=\RR$ and $\XX$ is some other set.  Furthermore, assume
  $\Pr_{\XX\times \YY}$ is a discrete joint distribution.
  Compute a Bayes decision function when
  the loss function $\ell:\AA\times\YY\to\RR$ is
  given by
  $$\ell(a,y) = \Ind(a\neq y),$$
  the $0-1$ loss.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol The Bayes decision function $f^*$ satisfies
  $$f^* = \argmin_f R(f) = \argmin_f \E[\Ind(f(X)\neq Y)] = \argmin_f
  \Pr(f(X)\neq Y),$$
  where $(X,Y)\sim \Pr_{\XX\times\YY}$.
  Let
  $$f_1(x) = \argmax_y \Pr(Y=y\mid X=x),$$
  the maximum a posteriori estimate of $Y$.
  If there is a tie, we choose any of the maximizers.  If $f_2$ is
  another decision function we have
  $$\begin{array}{rcll}
    \Pr(f_1(X)\neq Y)
    & = & \sum_x \Pr(f_1(x)\neq Y|X=x)\Pr(X=x)\\
    & = & \sum_x (1-\Pr(f_1(x)=Y|X=x))\Pr(X=x)\\
    & \leq & \sum_x (1-\Pr(f_2(x)=Y|X=x))\Pr(X=x) &\text{(Defn of
      $f_1$)}\\
    & = & \sum_x \Pr(f_2(x)\neq Y|X=x)\Pr(X=x)\\
    & = & \Pr(f_2(X)\neq Y).
  \end{array}$$
  Thus $f^*=f_1$.
\end{solution}
\item ($\star$) Suppose $\AA=\YY=\RR$, $\XX$ is some other set,
  and $\ell:\AA\times\YY\to\RR$ is given by
  $\ell(a,y)= (a-y)^2$, the square error loss.  What is the Bayes risk
  and how does it compare with the variance of $Y$?
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol From Homework~1 we know that the Bayes decision function
  is given by $f^*(x)=\E[Y|X=x]$.  Thus the Bayes risk is given by
  $$\E[(f^*(X)-Y)^2]=\E[(\E[Y|X]-Y)^2] = \E[\E[(\E[Y|X]-Y)^2|X]] = \E[\Var(Y|X)],$$
  where we applied the law of iterated expectations.
  The law of total variance states that
  $$\Var(Y) = \E[\Var(Y|X)] + \Var[\E(Y|X)].$$
  This proves the Bayes risk satisfies
  $$\E[\Var(Y|X)] = \Var(Y)-\Var[\E(Y|X)] \leq \Var(Y).$$
  Recall from Homework~1 that $\Var(Y)$ is the Bayes risk when we
  estimate $Y$ without any input $X$.  This shows that using $X$ in
  our estimation reduces the Bayes risk, and that the improvement is
  measured by $\Var[\E(Y|X)]$.  As a sanity check, note that if $X,Y$
  are independent then $\E(Y|X)=\E(Y)$ so $\Var[\E(Y|X)]=0$.  If $X=Y$
  then $\E(Y|X)=Y$ and $\Var[\E(Y|X)]=\Var(Y)$.

  The prominent role of variance in our analysis above is due to the
  fact that we are using the square loss.
\end{solution}
\item Let $\XX=\{1,\ldots,10\}$, let $\YY=\{1,\ldots,10\}$, and let
  $A=\YY$. Suppose the data generating distribution, $\PP$, has
  marginal $X\sim \Unif\{1,\ldots,10\}$ and conditional
  distribution $Y|X=x\sim \Unif\{1,\ldots,x\}$.  For each loss
  function below give a Bayes decision function.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ell(a,y) = (a-y)^2$,
  \item $\ell(a,y) = |a-y|$,
  \item $\ell(a,y) = \Ind(a\neq y)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item From Homework~1 we know that $f^*(x)=\E[Y|X=x]=(x+1)/2$.
  \item From Homework~1, we know that $f^*(x)$ is the conditional
    median of $Y$ given $X=x$.  If $x$ is odd, then $f^*(x)=(x+1)/2$.
    If $x$ is even, then we can choose any value in the interval
    $$\left[\left\lfloor \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rfloor,\left\lceil \frac{x+1}{2}\right\rceil\right].$$
  \item From question~1 above, we know that $f^*(x)=\argmax_y
    \Pr(Y=y|X=x)$.  Thus we can choose any integer between $1$ and $x$,
    inclusive, for $f^*(x)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
\item Show that the empirical risk is an unbiased and
  consistent estimator of the Bayes risk. You may assume the Bayes
  risk is finite.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol We assume a given loss function $\ell$ and an
  i.i.d.~sample $(x_1,y_i),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$.
  To show it is unbiased, note that
  $$\begin{Array}{rcll}
    \E[\hat{R}_n(f)]
    & = & \E\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(f(x_i),y_i)\right]\\
    & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\E[\ell(f(x_i),y_i)] &
    \text{(Linearity of $\E$)}\\
    & = & \E[\ell(f(x_1),y_1)] & \text{(i.i.d.)}\\
    & = & R(f).
  \end{Array}$$
  For consistency, we must show that as $n\to\infty$ we have
  $\hat{R}_n(f)\to R(f)$ with probability~1.  Letting
  $z_i=\ell(f(x_i),y_i)$, we see that the $z_i$ are i.i.d.~with finite
  mean.  Thus consistency follows by applying the strong law of large numbers.
\end{solution}
\item Let $\XX=[0,1]$ and $\YY=\AA=\RR$.  Suppose you receive the
  $(x,y)$ data points $(0,5)$, $(.2,3)$, $(.37,4.2)$, $(.9,3)$, $(1,5)$.  Throughout
  assume we are using the $0-1$ loss.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose we restrict our decision functions to the hypothesis
    space $\FF_1$ of constant functions.  Give a decision function that
    minimizes the empirical risk over $\FF_1$ and the corresponding
    empirical risk.  Is the empirical risk minimizing function unique?
  \item Suppose we restrict our decision functions to the hypothesis
    space $\FF_2$ of piecewise-constant functions with at most 1
    discontinuity.  Give a decision function that
    minimizes the empirical risk over $\FF_2$ and the corresponding
    empirical risk.  Is the empirical risk minimizing function unique?
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We can let $\hat{f}(x)=5$ or $\hat{f}(x)=3$ and obtain the
    minimal empirical risk of $3/5$.  Thus the empirical risk
    minimizer is not unique.
  \item One solution is to let $\hat{f}(x)=5$ for $x\in[0,.1]$ and
    $\hat{f}(x)=3$ for $x\in(.1,1]$ giving an empirical risk of
    $2/5$.  There are uncountably many empirical risk minimizers, so
    again we do not have uniqueness.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
\item $(\star)$ Let $\XX=[-10,10]$, $\YY=\AA=\RR$ and suppose the data generating
  distribution has marginal distribution $X\sim\Unif[-10,10]$ and
  conditional distribution $Y|X=x\sim
  \Norm(a+bx,1)$ for some fixed $a,b\in\RR$.  Suppose you are also
  given the following data points: $(0,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(1,3)$,
  $(2.5,3.1)$, $(-4,-2.1)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Assuming the $0-1$ loss, what is the Bayes risk?
  \item Assuming the square error loss $\ell(a,y)=(a-y)^2$, what is the Bayes risk?
  \item Using the full hypothesis space of all (measurable) functions,
    what is the minimum achievable empirical risk for the square error loss.
  \item Using the hypothesis space of all affine functions (i.e., of
    the form $f(x)=cx+d$ for some $c,d\in\RR$),
    what is the minimum achievable empirical risk for the square error loss.
  \item Using the hypothesis space of all quadratic functions (i.e., of
    the form $f(x)=cx^2+dx+e$ for some $c,d,e\in\RR$),
    what is the minimum achievable empirical risk for the square error
    loss.
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For any decision function $f$ the risk is given by
    $$\E[\Ind(f(X)\neq Y)] = \Pr(f(X)\neq Y) = 1 - \Pr(f(X)=Y)=1.$$
    To see this note that
    $$\Pr(f(X)=Y) =
    \frac{1}{20\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-10}^{10}\int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \Ind(f(x)=y)e^{-(y-a-bx)^2/2}\,dy\,dx
    = \frac{1}{20\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-10}^{10} 0\,dx = 0.$$
    Thus every decision function is a Bayes decision function, and the
    Bayes risk is~$1$.
  \item By problem~2 above we know the Bayes risk is given by
    $$\E[\Var(Y|X)] = \E[1]=1,$$
    since $\Var(Y|X=x)=1$.
  \item We choose $\hat{f}$ such that
    $$\hat{f}(0)=1.5, \hat{f}(1)=3, \hat{f}(2.5)=3.1,
    \hat{f}(-4)=2.1,$$
    and $\hat{f}(x)=0$ otherwise.  Then we achieve the minimum
    empirical risk of $1/10$.
  \item Letting
    $$A=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\1&0\\1&1\\1&2.5\\1&-4\end{pmatrix},\quad y =
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\\3.1\\-2.1\end{pmatrix}$$
    we obtain (using a computer)
    $$\hat{w}=\begin{pmatrix}\hat{d}\\\hat{c}\end{pmatrix} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^Ty
    = \begin{pmatrix}1.4856\\0.8556\end{pmatrix}.$$
    This gives
    $$\hat{R}_5(\hat{f}) = \frac{1}{5}\|A\hat{w}-y\|_2^2 = 0.2473.$$
    [Aside: In general, to solve systems like the one above on a computer you shouldn't actually invert
      the matrix $A^TA$, but use something like \lstinline!w=A\y! in
      Matlab which performs a QR factorization of $A$.]
  \item Letting
    $$A=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\1&0&0\\1&1&1\\1&2.5&6.25\\1&-4&16\end{pmatrix},\quad y =
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\\3.1\\-2.1\end{pmatrix}$$
    we obtain (using a computer)
    $$\hat{w}=\begin{pmatrix}\hat{e}\\\hat{d}\\\hat{c}\end{pmatrix} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^Ty
    = \begin{pmatrix}1.7175\\0.7545\\-0.0521\end{pmatrix}.$$
    This gives
    $$\hat{R}_5(\hat{f}) = \frac{1}{5}\|A\hat{w}-y\|_2^2 = 0.1928.$$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Topic 2: Stochastic Gradient Descent}
\subsubsection{Learning Objectives} % This is new.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Be able to write the empirical risk for a particular loss function over a particular parameterized hypothesis space, such as for square loss over a hypothesis space of linear functions.
\item Compare and constrast gradient descent, minibatch gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Concept Check Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item When performing mini-batch gradient descent, we often randomly choose
  the mini-batch from the full training set without replacement.
  Show that the resulting  mini-batch gradient is an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the
  full training set.  Here we assume each decision function $f_w$ in
  our hypothesis space is determined by a parameter vector $w\in\RR^d$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol Let $(x_{m_1},y_{m_1}),\ldots,(x_{m_n},y_{m_n})$ be our
  mini-batch selected uniformly without replacement from the full
  training set $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$.
  $$\begin{Array}{rcll}
    \E\left[\nabla_w\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
      \ell(f_w(x_{m_i},y_{m_i}))\right]
    & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\E\left[\nabla_w
      \ell(f_w(x_{m_i}),y_{m_i})\right] & \text{(Linearity of
      $\nabla,\E$)}\\
    & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\E\left[\nabla_w
      \ell(f_w(x_{m_1}),y_{m_1})\right]    &\text{(Marginals are the same)}\\
    & = & \E\left[\nabla_w\ell(f_w(x_{m_1}),y_{m_1})\right]\\
    & = & \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{N}\nabla_w\ell(f_w(x_{i}),y_{i})\\
    & = & \nabla_w\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N
    \ell(f_w(x_{i}),y_{i})&\text{(Linearity of $\nabla$).}
  \end{Array}$$
\end{solution}
\item You want to estimate the average age of the people visiting your
  website.  Over a fixed week we will receive a total of $N$
  visitors (which we will call our full population).  Suppose the population mean $\mu$
  is unknown but the variance $\sigma^2$ is known.  Since we don't
  want to bother every visitor, we will ask a small sample what their
  ages are.  How many visitors must we randomly sample
  so that our estimator $\hat{\mu}$ has variance at
  most $\epsilon>0$?
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ denote our randomly sampled ages, and
  let $\hat{x}$ denote the sample mean $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.
  Then
  $$\Var(\hat{x}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}.$$
  Thus we require $n\geq \sigma^2/\epsilon$.  Note that this doesn't
  depend on $N$, the full population size.
\end{solution}
\item ($\star$) Suppose you have been successfully
  running mini-batch gradient descent with
  a full training set size of $10^5$ and a mini-batch size of $100$.
  After receiving more data your full training set size increases to $10^9$.
  Give a heuristic argument as to why the mini-batch size need not
  increase even though we have $10000$ times more data.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol Throughout we assume our gradient lies in $\RR^d$.
  Consider the empirical distribution on the full training
  set (i.e., each sample is chosen with probability $1/N$ where $N$ is
  the full training set size).  Assume this distribution has mean
  vector $\mu\in\RR^d$ (the full-batch gradient) and covariance matrix
  $\Sigma\in\RR^{d\times d}$.  By the central
  limit theorem the mini-batch gradient will be approximately normally
  distributed with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\frac{1}{n}\Sigma$, where
  $n$ is the mini-batch size.  As $N$ grows the entries of $\Sigma$
  need not grow, and thus $n$ need not grow.
  In fact, as $N$ grows, the empirical mean and
  covariance matrix will converge to their true values.  More
  precisely, the mean of the empirical distribution
  will converge to $\E\nabla\ell(f(X),Y)$ and the covariance will
  converge to
  $$\E[(\nabla\ell(f(X),Y))(\nabla\ell(f(X),Y))^T]-\E[\nabla\ell(f(X),Y)]\E[\nabla\ell(f(X),Y)]^T$$
  where $(X,Y)\sim\Pr_{\XX\times\YY}$.

  The important takeaway here is that the size of the mini-batch is
  dependent on the speed of computation, and on the characteristics of
  the distribution of the gradients (such as the moments), and thus
  may vary independently of the size of the full training set.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
