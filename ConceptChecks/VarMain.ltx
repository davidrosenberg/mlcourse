\maketitle

\textbf{Instructions}: Following most lab and lecture sections, we will be providing concept checks for review. Each concept check will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item List the lab/lecture learning objectives. You will be responsible for mastering these objectives, and demonstrating mastery through homework assignments, exams (midterm and final), and on the final course project.
    \item Include concept check questions. These questions are intended to reinforce the lab/lectures, and help you master the learning objectives.
\end{itemize}
You are strongly encourage to complete all concept check questions, and to discuss these (and related) problems on Piazza and at office hours. However, problems marked with a ($\star$) are considered optional.
