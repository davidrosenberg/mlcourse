\section{Recitation 1: Gradients and Directional Derivatives}
\subsection{Intro Question}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We are given the data set $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ where
  $x_i\in\RR^d$ and $y_i\in\RR$.  We want to fit a linear function to
  this data by performing empirical risk minimization.  More
  precisely, we are using the hypothesis space $\FF=\{f(x)=w^Tx\mid
  w\in\RR^d\}$ and the loss function $\ell(a,y)=(a-y)^2$.  Given an
  initial guess $\tilde{w}$ for the empirical risk minimizing
  parameter vector, how could we improve our guess?
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol The empirical risk is given by
  $$\hat{R}_n(f) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(f(x_i),y_i) =
  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (w^Tx_i-y_i)^2
  = \frac{1}{n}\|Xw-y\|_2^2,$$
  where $X\in\RR^{n\times d}$ is the matrix whose $i$th row is given by $x_i$.
  Assuming $\tilde{w}$ is not the empirical risk minimizer, we can improve
  our guess by taking a sufficiently small step in the direction of
  the negative gradient.  In this particular example, we can also
  solve for the empirical risk minimizer analytically.
  This will be explained further below.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Multivariable Differentiation}
Differential calculus allows us to convert non-linear problems into
local linear problems, to which we can apply the well-developed
techniques of linear algebra.  Here we will review some of the
important concepts needed in the rest of the course.
\subsubsection{Single Variable Differentiation}
To gain intuition, we first recall the single variable case.  Let
$f:\RR\to\RR$ be differentiable.  The derivative
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
gives us a local linear approximation of $f$ near $x$.  This is seen
more clearly in the following form:
$$f(x+h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + o(h)\quad\text{as $h\to0$,}$$
where $o(h)$ represents a function $g(h)$ with $g(h)/h\to 0$ as
$h\to0$.  This can be used to show that if $x$ is a local extremum of
$f$ then $f'(x)=0$.  Points with $f'(x)=0$ are called \textit{critical points}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\asyinclude{1-gradients/Taylor1d.asy}
\caption{1D Linear Approximation By Derivative}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Multivariate Differentiation}
More generally, we will look at functions $f:\RR^n\to\RR$.  In the
single-variable case, the derivative was just a number that signified
how much the function increased when we moved in the positive
$x$-direction.  In the multivariable case, we have many possible
directions we can move along from a given point $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\RR^n$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\asyinclude{1-gradients/Directions.asy}
\caption{Multiple Possible Directions for $f:\RR^2\to\RR$}
\end{figure}
If we fix a direction $u$
we can compute the directional derivative $f'(x;u)$ as
$$f'(x;u) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hu)-f(x)}{h}.$$
This allows us to turn our multidimensional problem into a
1-dimensional computation.  For instance,
$$f(x+hu) = f(x) + hf'(x;u) + o(h),$$
mimicking our earlier 1-d formula.  This says that nearby $x$ we can
get a good approximation of $f(x+hu)$ using the linear approximation
$f(x)+hf'(x;u)$.  In particular, if $f'(x;u)<0$ (such a $u$ is called
a \textit{descent direction}) then for sufficiently small $h>0$ we have $f(x+hu)<f(x)$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\asyinclude{1-gradients/Slice.asy}
\caption{Directional Derivative as a Slope of a Slice}
\end{figure}
Let $e_i=(\overbrace{0,0,\ldots,0}^{i-1},1,0,\ldots,0)$ be the $i$th
standard basis vector.  The directional derivative in the direction
$e_i$ is called the $i$th partial derivative and can be written in
several ways:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} f(x)=\partial_{x_i}f(x)=\partial_i
f(x) = f'(x;e_i).$$

We say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ if
$$\lim_{v\to0}\frac{f(x+v)-f(x)-g^Tv}{\|v\|_2}=0,$$
for some $g\in\RR^n$ (note that the limit for $v$ is taken in
$\RR^n$).  This $g$ is uniquely determined, and is called
the gradient of $f$ at $x$ denoted by $\nabla f(x)$.  It is easy to
show that the gradient is the vector of partial derivatives:
$$\nabla f(x) =
\pMattt{\partial_{x_1}f(x)}{\vdots}{\partial_{x_n}f(x)}.$$
The $k$th entry of the gradient (i.e., the $k$th partial derivative)
is the approximate change in $f$ due to a small positive change in
$x_k$.  Sometimes we will split the variables of $f$ into two parts.
For instance, we could write $f(x,w)$ with $x\in\RR^p$ and
$w\in\RR^q$.  It is often useful to take the gradient with respect to
some of the variables.  Here we would write $\nabla_x$ or $\nabla_w$
to specify which part:
$$\nabla_x f(x,w) :=
\pMattt{\partial_{x_1}f(x,w)}{\vdots}{\partial_{x_p}f(x,w)}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\nabla_w f(x,w) :=
\pMattt{\partial_{w_1}f(x,w)}{\vdots}{\partial_{w_q}f(x,w)}.
$$

Analogous to the univariate case, can express the condition for
differentiability in terms of a gradient approximation:
$$f(x+v) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^Tv + o(\|v\|_2).$$
The approximation $f(x+v) \approx f(x)+\nabla f(x)^Tv$ gives a tangent
plane at the point $x$ as we let $v$ vary.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\asyinclude{1-gradients/Tangent.asy}
\caption{Tangent Plane for $f:\RR^2\to\RR$}
\end{figure}
If $f$ is differentiable, we can use the gradient to compute an arbitrary directional derivative:
$$f'(x;u) = \nabla f(x)^T u.$$
From this expression we can quickly see that (assuming $\nabla f(x)\neq0$)
$$\argmax_{\|u\|_2=1} f'(x;u) = \frac{\nabla f(x)}{\|\nabla f(x)\|_2}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\argmin_{\|u\|_2=1} f'(x;u) = -\frac{\nabla f(x)}{\|\nabla
  f(x)\|_2}.$$
In words, we say that the gradient points in the direction of
steepest ascent, and the negative gradient points in the direction of
steepest descent.

As in the 1-dimensional case, if $f:\RR^n\to\RR$ is differentiable and
$x$ is a local extremum of $f$ then we must have $\nabla f(x)=0$.
Points $x$ with $\nabla f(x)=0$ are called \textit{critical points}.
As we will see later in the course, if a function is differentiable
and convex, then a point is critical if and only if it is a global minimum.

\asyinclude{1-gradients/Saddle.asy}
\caption{Critical Points of $f:\RR^2\to\RR$}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Computing Gradients}
A simple method to compute the gradient of a function is to compute
each partial derivative separately.  For example, if $f:\RR^3\to\RR$
is given by
$$f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \log(1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3})$$
then we can directly compute
$$\hspace{-1cm}\partial_{x_1} f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \frac{e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}},\quad
\partial_{x_2} f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \frac{2e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}},\quad
\partial_{x_3} f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \frac{3e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}$$
and obtain
$$\nabla f(x_1,x_2,x_3) =
\PMattt{\frac{e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}}
{\frac{2e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}}
{\frac{3e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}{1+e^{x_1+2x_2+3x_3}}}.$$
Alternatively, we could let $w=(1,2,3)^T$ and write
$$f(x) = \log(1+e^{w^Tx}).$$
Then we can apply a version of the chain rule which says 
that if $g:\RR\to\RR$ and $h:\RR^n\to\RR$ are differentiable then
$$\nabla g(h(x)) = g'(h(x))\nabla h(x).$$
Applying the chain rule twice (for $\log$ and $\exp$) we obtain
$$\nabla f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{w^Tx}}e^{w^Tx}w,$$
where we use the fact that $\nabla_x(w^Tx) = w$.  This last expression
is more concise, and is more amenable to vectorized computation in
many languages.

Another useful technique is to compute a general directional
derivative and then infer the gradient from the computation.  For
example, let $f:\RR^n\to\RR$ be given by
$$f(x) = \|Ax-y\|_2^2 = (Ax-y)^T(Ax-y) = x^TA^TAx - 2y^TAx+y^Ty,$$
for some $A\in\RR^{m\times n}$ and $y\in\RR^m$.  Assuming $f$ is
differentiable (so that $f'(x;v)=\nabla f(x)^Tv$) we have
$$\begin{Array}{rcl}
  f(x+tv) 
  & = & (x+tv)^TA^TA(x+tv) - 2y^TA(x+tv) + y^Ty\\
  & = & x^TA^TAx + t^2v^TA^TAv + 2tx^TA^TAv - 2y^TAx - 2ty^TAv+y^Ty\\
  & = & f(x) + t(2x^TA^TA- 2y^TA)v +t^2v^TA^TAv.
\end{Array}$$
Thus we have
$$\frac{f(x+tv)-f(x)}{t} = (2x^TA^TA- 2y^TA)v + tv^TA^TAv.$$
Taking the limit as $t\to0$ shows
$$f'(x;v) = (2x^TA^TA- 2y^TA)v \implies \nabla f(x) = (2x^TA^TA-
2y^TA)^T = 2A^TAx - 2A^Ty.$$
Using this we can determine the critical points of $f$.
Let's assume here that $A$ has full column rank.  Then $A^TA$ is
invertible, and the unique critical point is
$x = (A^TA)^{-1}A^Ty$.  As we will see later in the course, this is a
global minimum since $f$ is convex (the \textit{Hessian} of $f$ satisfies $\nabla^2f(x) = 2A^TA\succ0$).

\subsubsection{$(\star)$ Proving Differentiability}
With a little extra work we can make the previous technique give a
proof of differentiability.  Using the computation above, we can rewrite
$f(x+v)$ as $f(x)$ plus terms depending on $v$:
$$f(x+v) = f(x) + (2x^TA^TA- 2y^TA)v + v^TA^TAv.$$
Note that
$$\frac{v^TA^TAv}{\|v\|_2} = \frac{\|Av\|_2^2}{\|v\||_2} \leq
\frac{\|A\|_2^2\|v\|_2^2}{\|v\|_2} = \|A\|_2^2\|v\|_2\to 0,$$
as $\|v\|_2\to0$. (This section is starred since we used the matrix
norm $\|A\|_2$ here.)
This shows $f(x+v)$ above has the form
$$f(x+v) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^Tv + o(\|v\|_2).$$
This proves that $f$ is differentiable and that 
$$\nabla f(x) = 2A^TAx - 2A^Ty.$$
Another method we could have used to establish differentiability is to
observe that the partial derivatives are all continuous.  This relies
on the following theorem.
\begin{thm}
  Let $f:\RR^n\to\RR$ and suppose $\partial_{x_i}f(x):\RR^n\to\RR$ is
  continuous for all $x\in\RR^n$ and all $i=1,\ldots,n$.  Then $f$ is
  differentiable. 
\end{thm}
