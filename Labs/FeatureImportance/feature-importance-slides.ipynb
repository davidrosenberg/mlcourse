    "# Feature Importance outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature importance\n",
    "- Introduction and motivation for discussing feature importance:\n",
    "    - Define feature importance (using a fuzzy definition -- rank features by how much they \"*contribute*\" to the prediction function).\n",
    "    - Feature importance measures are frequently reported, in part because many packages make them easy to compute/visualize.\n",
    "        - Show google image search results\n",
    "    - They can be potentially misleading. Important to understand potential pitfalls.\n",
    "    - Utility of feature importance:\n",
    "        - Feature selection -- use votes example from original Breiman Random Forests paper.\n",
    "        - Sanity checking models/detecting leakage (TODO: see if I can find an example where feature importance show some feature unexpectedly popping since due to leakage).\n",
    "- Framing feature importance methods:\n",
    "    - Divide into two classes:\n",
    "        - Methods that exploit the structure of the prediction function or learning algorithm (call these function-specific).\n",
    "        - Methods that are agnostic (i.e. can be applied to any black box prediction function).\n",
    "- Function-specific methods:\n",
    "    - Mean decrease impurity:\n",
    "        - Frame running example:\n",
    "            - Introduce the iris dataset and classification problem.\n",
    "            - graphviz some shallow tree on the iris dataset (see below).\n",
    "            - **Ask students** which features seem \"important\" as a turn and talk. Have some subset share answers without explanation.\n",
    "        - Introduce MDE:\n",
    "        $$Imp(X_m) = \\frac{1}{N_T}\\sum_T\\sum_{t \\in T:v(s_t)=X_m}p(t)\\Delta i(s_t,t)$$\n",
    "        - Show from scratch implimentation (see lab_outline_and_mean_decrease_impurity.ipynb).\n",
    "        - Show correspondance with sklearn's implementation.\n",
    "        - **Ask students** what other classifiers we could extend this too (Random Forests/GBMs) and how (averaging).\n",
    "        - Show RF importance for the iris problem.\n",
    "        - Say there are variants:\n",
    "            - Example: CART implementation exposes a knob to add weight for use of a feature as a surrogate split.\n",
    "    - Absolute coefficients in a linear model:\n",
    "        - **Ask students** how we could determine feature importance in a linear model.\n",
    "        - Show some example (TODO) of extracting absolute $\\beta$s from a model.\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: How would this interact with preprocessing?\n",
    "- Model agnostic methods:\n",
    "    - Frame the general problem for global feature importance:\n",
    "        - Another framing of feature importance -- we are trying to identify how much each feature independently contributes to risk reduction in the learned model.\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: How could we do this for an arbitrary black box prediction function?\n",
    "        - **Hint (fragment slide)**: Imagine you were tasked with constructing a synthetic dataset with an *unimportant* feature -- how could you construct it? Given this insight, what operation could be applied to a feature that would be expected to have (a) no impact on empirical risk for unimportant features, and (b) decrease performance for important featuers?\n",
    "    - Permutation importance:\n",
    "        - Give Breimans original OOB permutation feature importance.\n",
    "        - Say that the OOB version exploits bootstrapping in RFs, but can just use a validation set.\n",
    "        - Show example (using ELI5 implementation) over the iris problem.\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: This method permute features to get a measure of feature importance. Let's extend this concept a bit -- how could permuting the target be useful in interogating the performance of a model?\n",
    "        - http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/ojala10a/ojala10a.pdf\n",
    "        - For fun show this using permutation_test_score for the iris data.\n",
    "- Pitfalls:\n",
    "    - Correlated features\n",
    "        - Show the GBM feature importance for duplicated or highly correlated features (TODO: think about which is better for this purpose) (from lab_outline_and_mean_decrease_impurity.ipynb).\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: Interpret this plot. What can we say about the features/model?\n",
    "        - Show same plot for enet, and ask same question -- hopefully students will recall that (at least in the context of linear models) our conversations about feature correlation.\n",
    "        - Show the elastnic net bound result as review, and primer to think about correlation issues.\n",
    "        - Show correlation matrix/matrices (duplicated and/or highly correlated), and known data generating process.\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: Given what we know about (i) linear methods, and (ii) trees, what does this show us about potential pitfalls in interpreting feature importance plots?\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: How would this impact SelectFromModel feature selection procedures (ala sklearn) which select the most important features from a model based on either absolute coefficients or feature importance scores? Why might we want to use RFE?\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDPs\n",
    "- Motivation and introduction to partial dependence plots\n",
    "    - Imagine we have a subset of features we think are important.\n",
    "        - This could be based on \"feature importance\" scores or coefficients, or other reasons (i.e. prior knowledge/research questions/etc.).\n",
    "    - We may want to dig deeper to explain the relationship between our predictions and these features.\n",
    "        - **Ask students**: Why? If we have MDI feature importance scores in hand, what do we not know?\n",
    "            - Directionality:\n",
    "                - Note in reality we probably have complex, non-monotonic relationships\n",
    "                - However even if we have a monotonic relationship, or even linear, our MDI wouldn't give any indication on the direction -- obviously weights in a linear model would.\n",
    "    - Partial dependence plots let us dig deeper and visualize the dependence of our prediction function (i.e. predict/predict_proba) on one or two of these features. Can't easily go higher-dimensional (Why not? Can't visualize).\n",
    "    - Show basic math (marginal and empirical estimate -- see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf for useful framing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- PDP examples:\n",
    "    - Show sklearn example (see partial_dependence.ipynb).\n",
    "    - **Ask students**: What does this plot show? How do we interpret it? \n",
    "- PDP pitfalls:\n",
    "    - Show the flat partial dependence plot from (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf) reproduced in partial_dependence.ipynb.\n",
    "    - **Ask students**: What does this plot show?\n",
    "    - Follow up with big reveal:\n",
    "        - Show data generating process and X plot.\n",
    "    - **Ask students**: What does this teach us? When might PDPs fail?\n",
    "    - Share \"not too strong\" quote from Friedman's original work (see partial_dependence.ipynb).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Additional material\n",
    "- If 100 minutes allows (what is your opinion, David?), the next steps would be:\n",
    "    - Generate the ICE plot for the X data (figure 2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf)\n",
    "    - Take this  as a launching point for point out that our progression has been from:\n",
    "        - Global measures (feature importance) that don't necessarily describe structure (even directionality) of a relationship between a feature and target.\n",
    "        - Marginalized measures showing average relationship between one or two features and the target.\n",
    "        - Data-instance specific feature importance plots showing the importance of a feature, for each data instance, fixing all other feature values.\n",
    "    - We can follow this thread it's conclusion -- attempting to develop model explanations that show the relative contribution of each feature to predictions locally (i.e. in the neighborhood of a specific instance):\n",
